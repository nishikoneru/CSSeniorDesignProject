Rachel Individual Hours Spring Semester:
12/30/22 4pm - 7pm:
Time spent: 3 hours
Total: 3 hours
Worked on creating basic test python code (created image of random pixels)
and getting it to run in C# (ran using the command prompt)
1/7/22 6pm - 8pm:
Time spent: 2 hours
Total: 5 hours
Looked into and worked on changing how C# runs, now uses a .exe that contains the python code
Should be easier to package.
1/13/22 5pm-7:30pm
Time Spent: 2.5 hours
total: 7.5 hours
Looked into displaying images in unity from C# code (as opposed to using them as assets when
building the game). Current plan is to have python write images to a folder and have C# display them
around the museum.
1/18/23 10:30pm - 11:30 pm
Time spent: 1 hour
Total: 8.5 hours
Worked on creating a health and safety document focusing on the effects of VR.
1/27/23 4:30pm -6:30pm
Time spent: 2 hours
Total: 10.5 hours
Looked into more ways to run C# code that isn't directly from Windows (Such as command line or .exe)
Since the Oculus headset we're using runs on Android. Couldn't get Iron python to work for more advanced
libraries and couldn't just save python as a .apk file.
2/1/23 4pm - 5:00 pm
Time spent: 1 hour
Total 11.5 hours
Met with advisor alone to ask questions about integration.
Then met with Scott and got my current integration code working in the test museum.
2/16/23 12pm - 1pm
Time spent: 1 hour
Total 12.5 hours
Met with William Hawkins at the suggestion of my advisor to discussing python and C# integration.
He suggested pyjion which I will try sometime next week.
2/17/23 9pm-10pm
Time spent: 1 hour
Total: 13.5 hours
Researched Pyjion a bit, it seems what he's suggesting is possible, but it's going to take a lot of work.
2/23/23 8pm - 10:30pm
Time spent: 2.5 hours
Total: 16 hours
Looked more into pyjion. Could download it but wasn't able to access from the command line following
their basic intructions on github. I also found a question from someone asking something similar to what we're
trying to do (https://github.com/tonybaloney/Pyjion/discussions/303) and it seems there are no plans to add in integration 
between C# and if the developers of pyjion are calling it too much work, I think it's probably not worth pursuing for this project. 
Some more research and suggestions by pyjion led me to Python.NET and Python.Included, plan on testing them out tomorrow.
2/24/23 8:30pm - 10:30 pm
Time spent: 2 hours
Total: 18 hours
Python.Included won't work with unity, got an error just trying to load it in.
Got Python.NET to work with numpy in unity, not our exact code, but a good step in the right direction.
Noticed it only likes to use libraries that can be installed with pip, had some problems trying to use PIL (how I was originally saving the image)
3/1/23 5pm - 8pm
Time spent: 3 hours
Total 21 hours
Skimmed through python code provided by Nishi, since it requires downloads from github. It won't work 
with Python.NET. She also said the github downloads can't be removed.
Got it working with replicate though (https://replicate.com/dribnet/pixray-text2image/api)
It requires a server but we do have ai generated images in python working, will test getting it to work with C# later.
I also got it working with stable diffusion (https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion) using the same site.
3/4/23 3pm-6pm
Time spent: 3 hours
Total: 24 hours
Integrated the replicate python code with C#, we have ai generated bears in unity now.
Also added in my code for displaying the image as well, so that we could actually view the bears in
our gallery.
3/4/23 9pm - 12am
Time spent: 3 hours
Total: 27 hours
Tested and built on android, it crashed on startup. Had to look into how crash logs work with unity.
Still not sure of the problem.
Decided to try and test on my headset but I had to update my drivers among other things.
Will try testing on the headset tomorrow.
3/5/23 11am - 1pm
Time spent: 2 hours
Total: 29 hours
Got the headset working, can test using the headset from unity. Tried to build from windows
and the app crashed on startup again. Not sure what the problem is still though.
3/5/23 6 pm - 10 pm
Time spent: 4 hours
Total: 33 hours
Went back to testing, found out there is only a limited number of uses for replicate without
spending money. Don't want to spend money. Found a version of stability AI that can be used through
python pip installs that works on my computer. Only problem is generation requires CUDA, available on
my computer but not available on Android or one of my teammates computer.
Tested and works displaying 1 bear image now.
3/6/23 3pm - 4:30 pm
Time spent 1.5 hours
Total: 34.5 hours
Did some more testing before we planned on presenting our demo with our advisor Thursday
3/6/23 6pm - 8 pm
Time spent 2 hours
Total: 36.5 hours
Did more testing and got current code to display more than 1 image, previously just showed 1 image
in the gallery, now it shows all 3 images in our test gallery.
Also tested NSFW filter, library has one but sometimes stuff slips through.
3/11/23 4pm - 4:30 pm
Time spent 0.5 hours
Total: 37 hours
Made some sample images so the gallery didn't look so empty.
3/19/23 10am - 3 pm
Time spent: 5 hours
Total: 42 hours
Worked on getting images to generate in the background based on suggestiosn by our advisor.
This involved threading in Unity and took a bit longer than I would have liked.
We still have some small lag when the thread starts but it's a lot better
than waiting 3 minutes to generate images before users can enter the gallery.
3/23/23 1:30pm - 2:30 pm
Time Spent: 1 hour
Total: 43 hours
Recorded demo of current code and edited our recorded presentation.
Then stitched the two together
4/3/23 6:00pm - 5:00 am
Time Spent: 11 hours
Total 54 hours
Finally got finished museum, trying to get the generation code to work with it.
Takes 10 minutes for unity to even launch and it crashes a lot. Still can't get
code to work getting weird "Python not initialized" error. It's initialized
before the python section is called though.
4/4/23: 1 pm - 5 pm
Time spent: 4 hours
Total 58 hours
Found the problem, there was leftover image generation from Scott's testing that
we forgot to remove. Reduced loading time down to basically nothing and removed
my python errors. Tested museum and added in small changes to prevent crashing
due to user negligence
4/5/23: 9:30 am - 10:30am
Time spent: 1 hour
Total: 59 hours
Recorded demo video and voice over, edited two together for Senior Expo

Total Individual: 59 hours
Group meeting hours: 20 hours
Total time spent, spring semester: 79 hours
Total tim spent, fall semester: 50 hours, see appendix
