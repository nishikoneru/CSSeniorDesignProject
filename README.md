### Project Abstract
Our project is a virtual reality (VR) application that we will run using a Oculus Meta 2 virtual reality headset. This application will allow the users to browse an art gallery created in Unity, with the help of Python, which will display pieces of art generated using artificial intelligence (AI), these images will not be saved between uses unless specifically requested.
