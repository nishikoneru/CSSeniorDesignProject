### DALL-E 3 Design Diagram Conventions
We are developing a virtual reality (VR) application that allows the user to browse an art gallery exhibiting paintings generated using artificial intelligence (AI).

- The stick figure represents the user.
- The boxes with rounded corners represent processes or actions taken by the system or user.
- The arrows between the boxes represent the transitions from one process to the next.
- The rhombus represents a question that results in a "yes"/"no" or "true"/"false" answer. The result is dependent on the user's choice.
