Description of the Diagrams: including conventions and a brief description of the purpose of each component.
For all diagrams, the stick figure represents the user and the code's actions follow the arrow directions.

Diagram 0:
	The user starts by inputing a prompt, the art is then generated using AI
	and finally the art is displayed in the museum for the user.
Diagram 1: 
	The user picks a theme from a list to be used for generating picture. The input is then passed to the AI
	code before the AI generates images with the theme in mind. Unity then displays these images and the User can walk
	around the gallery to view them. They can then return to the start and create new images if they choose or end the program.
Diagram 2:
	The input list of themes is displayed from a dropdown so that the user can pick a prompt from the list. The
	input is recorded by Unity and then sent to python code as an input. The AI chooses a generating technique that
	best fits the input and trains before creating output images. These images are then displayed by unity within the
	virtual museum and the user is able to walk around the gallery and view images as they please. If they wish, they
	can return to the start to create new images for the gallery or end the program.
